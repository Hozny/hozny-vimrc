# hozny-vimrc
My current vim setup and will update the repository to reflect any changes. 

# Setup
I currently use `nvim` with `plug`. 

My vim setup is heavily inspired by ThePrimeagen, if you would like to set something similar up check out his tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9k9scbTuvQ)
